"""UPDATED VERSION

Key Fixes:
while True instead of while balance > 0 ->>>>>>>> This prevents balance modification from affecting the loop condition.

Moved if balance <= 0 outside the for-loop ->>>>>>>> Now, the check happens only after 12 months, ensuring proper validation.

Stopped both loops with break when the correct payment is found ->>>>>>> The previous version only broke the inner loop.

Removed unnecessary print statements inside the loop ->>>>>>> The final print is enough.

Now, the code correctly finds the lowest payment that clears the balance in 12 months. ðŸ”¥ Let me know if this makes sense! ðŸš€
