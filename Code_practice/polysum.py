"""A regular polygon has n number of sides. Each side has length s.

The area of a regular polygon is: (0.25*n*s**2)/tan(Ï€/n)

The perimeter of a polygon is: length of the boundary of the polygon
This means that:-
P is the summation of the sides length(s) from i= 1 to n

However,
For a regular polygon (where all sides are equal), the formula simplifies to:
P= n * s
where:
n is the number of sides
s is the length of each side

Write a function called polysum that takes 2 arguments, n and s. This function should sum the area and square of the perimeter of the regular polygon. The function returns the sum, rounded to 4 decimal places.
