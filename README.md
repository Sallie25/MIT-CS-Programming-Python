# Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python (MIT)

This repository contains my solutions, exercises, and practice codes from the **Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python** course offered by MIT. I took the **audit version** of the course, which provided me with access to lectures, assignments, and exercises for self-paced learning.

## Structure of the Repository

### Exercises and Practice Codes
Throughout the course, I worked on various **practice exercises** and **small coding problems** to reinforce the concepts covered in the lectures. These exercises helped build my understanding of fundamental programming concepts using Python.

### Problem Sets (PSet 1 - 5)
Each problem set represents a structured approach to solving real-world problems using Python. In this repository, I documented my thought process, code implementation, and any challenges encountered while solving these problem sets. The problem sets include:

- **PSet 1:** Basic computational concepts, simple Python programs, and control flow.
- **PSet 2:** Iteration, recursion, and testing.
- **PSet 3:** Structured data types, functions, and debugging.
- **PSet 4:** Algorithmic efficiency and complexity.
- **PSet 5:** Object-oriented programming and real-world applications.

## Installation & Setup
To run the code in this repository, ensure you have Python installed on your system. I used **VS Code** as my code editor. Follow these steps to set up:

1. Install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
2. Install VS Code from [code.visualstudio.com](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
3. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-link>
   ```
4. Open the project folder in VS Code and start coding!

## How to Use
- Navigate to the **exercises/** folder for practice problems.
- Check the **problem_sets/** folder for structured problem solutions.
- Run any script using:
  ```sh
  python filename.py
  ```

## Key Learnings
- Python fundamentals (variables, loops, conditionals, functions, recursion, and OOP)
- Computational problem-solving techniques
- Algorithmic thinking and efficiency considerations
- Writing clean, modular, and well-documented code

## Future Improvements
I plan to revisit some of the problem sets to optimize solutions and apply additional concepts like:
- Advanced algorithms
- Data structures
- Performance optimization techniques

This repository serves as a reference for my learning journey and problem-solving approach throughout the course.
